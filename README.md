Brain Tumor Classification using DeepLabV3+

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using a semantic segmentation model based on DeepLabV3+, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture. The aim is to accurately identify and classify brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques.
